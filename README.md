**About**

My attempt at learning [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) came at roughly the same time I wanted to revamp my [personal blog](http://robwilliams.me), so I decided to try to implement a Wordpress theme in Ember.

It is proving to be a good learning experience because I had to deal with some complex Ember topics in order to get things working like I want to.
